        <h3>R2's secret</h3>

In the search for a relevant problem to be solved, we observed the landscape of 
fintechs and financial management apps, exploring the advancements in open finance 
and other trends. One standout was PIX, a Brazilian instant payment service, known 
for its speed spread and the change it brought to citizens' financial behavior. This raised the question:
 Is it possible to create an alternative credit solution using PIX? This question sparked 
 an investigation to understand the feasibility of such an endeavor. Initially, we believed 
 the solution could be remarkably simple. We envisioned finding a company that could serve as 
 infrastructure and, with just a few lines of code, launch an operation connecting buyers and 
 sellers on a personalized experience platform, earning rewards through transaction differences.
  With this in mind, we began our research and engaged with various potential players who, 
  in theory, could provide the necessary credit infrastructure.
 <br><br>
 We discovered, however, that the discussion was turning towards the need to structure a Receivables 
 Investment Fund (FIDC). But what exactly is an FIDC? It is an entity composed of various agents 
 with the purpose of facilitating the buying and selling of credit rights, such as checks, bills, 
 credit card installments, and invoices. At this point, the question arose: How could we undertake 
 this endeavor? For a small entrepreneur, the lack of financial resources and licensing proved to be 
 a substantial barrier. We recognized that this constituted a significant problem and began to envision 
 potential solutions. However, the complexity of the issue extended beyond the scope of FIDCs, as various
  other structures such as hedge funds, private equity, and real estate were also costly, inefficient, and analogous.
 <br><br>
 Our imagination led us to conceive an automated and secure structure to execute this operation.
 <br><br>
 Starting with private credit. In Brazil there was already the implementation of Credit Card registers, a legal guardian
 which separated the figure of the acquirer in card receivables anticipation operations. Initiatives 
 like this and the creation of DREX, a platform for issuing fiat currency based on a distributed and 
 immutable database, promised to accelerate the development of these autonomous systems.
 <br><br>
 Initially, each type of structure would need to be independently and manually automated. In the case of FIDCs, 
 automation would encompass the connection between the custodian, administrator, originator, and borrower.
 Eliminating the need for independent audits and credit rating agencies, as these functions could be 
 incorporated through lines of code, leveraging current decentralized database and intelligent processing 
 technologies. This automation could also optimize the allocation and distribution of resources.
<br><br>
The automation of such structures could ultimately have applications that go beyond the currently
 envisioned scope, serving as a synthetic bridge between the physical and digital worlds.
